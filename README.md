## FAQs
**What’s the main difference between a bot and an anti-detect browser?**  
A bot automates actions on Facebook, while an anti-detect browser isolates sessions and fingerprints across accounts without automating tasks.

**Is one option safer than the other?**  
Anti-detect browsers generally reduce cross-account fingerprinting risk, but both have platform policy exposure depending on usage patterns.

**Can I use both together?**  
Yes, you can pair bots for automation with anti-detect browsers for safer multi-account separation if needed.

**Which choice is better for content scheduling?**  
Bots typically provide scheduling and task automation, while anti-detect browsers focus on session management without built-in automation workflows.
